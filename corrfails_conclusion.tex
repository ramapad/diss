In this chapter, I showed how to detect dependent residential disruption events using individual address disruptions. Using the binomial test, I detected events where multiple addresses that are related to each other by geography and ISP fail simultaneously such that the failures are unlikely to have occurred independently. The technique is capable of detecting large known
disruption events, such as power outages during times of severe
thunderstorms, but importantly, can also detect much smaller
events. By analyzing these events, I demonstrated that prior techniques which detect dependent disruptions affecting a substantial number of addresses in BGP prefixes or /24 address blocks can miss observing these events. These results motivate finding individual address outages for measuring residential Internet reliability.
