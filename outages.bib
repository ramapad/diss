annote={" Thus, we expected to find typical session lengths
                  of several hours. However, we find instead
                  that many are quite short. We base our
                  analysis on Radius [43] logs, which many
                  European ISPs use for authentication and
                  IP address leasing. Radius supports two
                  timeouts, SessionTimeout and IdleTimeout,
                  though the monitored ISP only makes use of
                  the first. SessionTimeout performs a role
                  similar to the DHCP lease time, limiting
                  the maximum lifetime of a session. The ISP
                  sets it to 24 hr (a popular choice among
                  Euro- pean ISPs [52, 37]). DSL home
                  routers generally offer an option to
                  reconnect immediately after a session
                  expires. However, in contrast to DHCP,
                  Radius does not provide an option to
                  request a particular IP address (e.g., the
                  previously used IP address), and the ISP
                  allows addresses to change across
                  sessions."}
