with options, raising serious dependability issues. Surpris- 
ingly, our findings indicate that it is feasible to restore sup- 
port for options in the wide-area. We discovered that the 
core of the network drops very few options packets, with the 
vast majority of those drops occurring in edge AS networks. 
Furthermore, these drops are concentrated in a minority of 
the ASes. "

                  measurement study of the Skype VoIP
                  system. From the empirical data we have
                  gathered, it is clear that Skype differs
                  significantly from other peer-to-peer
                  file-sharing networks in several
                  respects. Active clients show diurnal and
                  work-week behavior analogous to
                  web-browsing rather than
                  file-sharing. Stability of the supernode
                  population tends to mitigate churn in the
                  network. Supernodes typically use little
                  bandwidth even though they relay VoIP and
                  file-transfer traffic in certain
                  cases. While the observations above are
                  clear from our data, we mention other
                  observations that are not so clear and are
                  preliminary in nature. In particular,
                  further study of the experimental data
                  results in some preliminary observations
                  that indicate that it is possible that
                  Skype calls are significantly longer than
                  calls in traditional telephone networks,
                  while files transferred over Skype are
                  significantly smaller than those over
                  file-sharing networks; further work is
                  required to validate these preliminary
                  observations. Overall, we present
                  measurement data useful for designing and
                  modeling a peer-to-peer VoIP system. Even
                  though this data is limited due to the
                  proprietary nature of Skype, we believe
                  that this study could server as a basis
                  for further understanding and discussing
                  the differences between peer-to-peer
                  file-sharing and peer-to-peer VoIP
                  systems. }

                  BGP4 has grown significantly. RFC1930
                  outlines a set of guidelines for when one
                  needs and should use an AS. However, the
                  customer and service provider (ISP) are
                  left with a problem as a result of this in
                  that while there is no need for an
                  allocated AS under the guidelines, certain
                  conditions make the use of BGP4 a very
                  pragmatic and perhaps only way to connect
                  a customer homed to a single ISP. This
                  paper proposes a solution to this problem
                  in line with recommendations set forth in
