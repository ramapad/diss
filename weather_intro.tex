\label{cpt:weather}

One aspect of measuring Internet reliability is to determine if the occurrence of certain events adversely affects Internet connectivity. Consider the occurrence of adverse weather conditions for instance: prior work has shown that Internet outages occur more frequently during times of precipitation~\cite{pingin}. However, this work was preliminary in nature and was performed over a short duration (three months). % Further, it treated every instance of a previously responsive address failing to respond to pings as an outage, ignoring the effects of dynamic addressing.

In this section, I discuss a technique to quantify the effect of
external factors, such as the occurrence of various weather
conditions, upon Internet connectivity of residential addresses using
measurements from the Thunderping probing system~\cite{pingin}. The
technique mitigates false outages due to dynamic addressing and user
behavior. First, I verify that weather conditions do not positively
correlate with peak diurnal failure periods, where dynamic addressing
or false outages due to user behavior are common. Next, I quantify
the absolute increase in the number of outages observed during
weather, when compared to non-weather periods---the outage
inflation---for several types of weather including times with
precipitation and times with extreme temperatures and high winds. By
studying outage inflation of various link types and geographic regions
across weather conditions, I am able to identify networks that are
vulnerable to weather.
